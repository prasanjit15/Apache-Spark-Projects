India (Hindi: Bhārat), officially the Republic of India (Hindi: Bhārat Gaṇarājya),[23] is a country in South Asia.
 It is the second-most populous country, the seventh-largest country by land area, and the most populous 
democracy in the world. Bounded by the Indian Ocean on the south, the Arabian Sea on the southwest, 
and the Bay of Bengal on the southeast, it shares land borders with Pakistan to the west;[f] China, Nepal, 
and Bhutan to the north; and Bangladesh and Myanmar to the east. In the Indian Ocean, India is in the vicinity of 
Sri Lanka and the Maldives; its Andaman and Nicobar Islands share a maritime border with Thailand and Indonesia.
Modern humans arrived on the Indian subcontinent from Africa no later than 55,000 years ago.[24]
 Their long occupation, initially in varying forms of isolation as hunter-gatherers, has made the region 
highly diverse, second only to Africa in human genetic diversity.[25] Settled life emerged on the subcontinent
 in the western margins of the Indus river basin 9,000 years ago, evolving gradually into the Indus Valley Civilisation 
of the third millennium BCE.[26] By 1200 BCE, an archaic form of Sanskrit, an Indo-European language, had diffused 
into India from the northwest, unfolding as the language of the Rigveda, and recording the dawning of Hinduism in India.[27] The Dravidian languages of India were supplanted in the northern and western regions.[28] By 400 BCE, stratification and exclusion by caste had emerged within Hinduism,[29] and Buddhism and Jainism had arisen, 
proclaiming social orders unlinked to heredity.[30] Early political consolidations gave rise to the loose-knit Maurya
 and Gupta Empires based in the Ganges Basin.[31] Their collective era was suffused with wide-ranging creativity,[32]
 but also marked by the declining status of women,[33] and the incorporation of untouchability into an organised 
system of belief.[g][34] In South India, the Middle kingdoms exported Dravidian-languages scripts and religious cultures
 to the kingdoms of Southeast Asia.[35]
In the early medieval era, Christianity, Islam, Judaism, and Zoroastrianism put down roots on India's southern and 
western coasts.[36] Muslim armies from Central Asia intermittently overran India's northern plains,[37] eventually establishing the Delhi Sultanate, and drawing northern India into the cosmopolitan networks of medieval Islam.[38] 
In the 15th century, the Vijayanagara Empire created a long-lasting composite Hindu culture in south India.[39] In the Punjab, Sikhism emerged, rejecting institutionalised religion.[40] The Mughal Empire, in 1526, ushered in two centuries 
of relative peace,[41] leaving a legacy of luminous architecture.[h][42] Gradually expanding rule of the British East India Company followed, turning India into a colonial economy, but also consolidating its sovereignty.[43] British Crown rule began in 1858. The rights promised to Indians were granted slowly,[44] but technological changes were introduced, 
and ideas of education, modernity and the public life took root.[45] A pioneering and influential nationalist movement emerged, which was noted for nonviolent resistance and became the major factor in ending British rule.[46] In 1947 the 
British Indian Empire was partitioned into two independent dominions, a Hindu-majority Dominion of India and a Muslim-majority Dominion of Pakistan, amid large-scale loss of life and an unprecedented migration.[47][48]
India has been a secular federal republic since 1950, governed in a democratic parliamentary system. It is a 
pluralistic, multilingual and multi-ethnic society. India's population grew from 361 million in 1951 to 1,211 million in 2011.
[49] During the same time, its nominal per capita income increased from US$64 annually to US$1,498, and its literacy
 rate from 16.6% to 74%. From being a comparatively destitute country in 1951,[50] India has become a fast-growing major economy, a hub for information technology services, with an expanding middle class.[51] It has a space 
programme which includes several planned or completed extraterrestrial missions. Indian movies, music, and spiritual teachings play an increasing role in global culture.[52] India has substantially reduced its rate of poverty, though at the
 cost of increasing economic inequality.[53] India is a nuclear-weapon state, which ranks high in military expenditure.
 It has disputes over Kashmir with its neighbours, Pakistan and China, unresolved since the mid-20th century.[54]
 Among the socio-economic challenges India faces are gender inequality, child malnutrition,[55] and rising levels of 
air pollution.[56] India's land is megadiverse, with four biodiversity hotspots.[57] Its forest cover comprises 21.4% of
 its area.[58] India's wildlife, which has traditionally been viewed with tolerance in India's culture,[59] is supported 
among these forests, and elsewhere, in protected habitats.
By 55,000 years ago, the first modern humans, or Homo sapiens, had arrived on the Indian subcontinent from Africa, where they had earlier evolved.[69][70][71] The earliest known modern human remains in South Asia date to about 30,000 years ago.[72] After 6500 BCE, evidence for domestication of food crops and animals, construction of permanent structures, and storage of agricultural surplus appeared in Mehrgarh and other sites in what is now Balochistan.[73] These gradually developed into the Indus Valley Civilisation,[74][73] the first urban culture in South Asia,[75] which flourished during 2500–1900 BCE in what is now Pakistan and western India.[76] Centred around cities such as Mohenjo-daro, Harappa, Dholavira, and Kalibangan, and relying on varied forms of subsistence, the civilisation engaged robustly in crafts production and wide-ranging trade.[75]During the period 2000–500 BCE, many regions of the subcontinent transitioned from the Chalcolithic cultures to the Iron Age ones.[77] The Vedas, the oldest scriptures associated with Hinduism,[78] were composed during
 this period,[79] and historians have analysed these to posit a Vedic culture in the Punjab region and the upper Gangetic Plain.[77] Most historians also consider this period to have encompassed several waves of Indo-Aryan migration into
 the subcontinent from the north-west.[78] The caste system, which created a hierarchy of priests, warriors, and free peasants, but which excluded indigenous peoples by labelling their occupations impure, arose during this period.[80]
 On the Deccan Plateau, archaeological evidence from this period suggests the existence of a chiefdom stage of
 political organisation.[77] In South India, a progression to sedentary life is indicated by the large number of megalithic monuments dating from this period,[81] as well as by nearby traces of agriculture, irrigation tanks, and craft 
traditions.[81]
In the late Vedic period, around the 6th century BCE, the small states and chiefdoms of the Ganges Plain and the north-western regions had consolidated into 16 major oligarchies and monarchies that were known as the mahajanapadas.[82][83] The emerging urbanisation gave rise to non-Vedic religious movements, two of which became independent religions. Jainism came into prominence during the life of its exemplar, Mahavira.[84] Buddhism, based on the teachings of Gautama Buddha, attracted followers from all social classes excepting the middle class; chronicling the life of the Buddha was central to the beginnings of recorded history in India.[85][86][87] In an age of increasing urban wealth, both religions held up renunciation as an ideal,[88] and both established long-lasting monastic traditions. Politically, by the 3rd century BCE, the kingdom of Magadha had annexed or reduced other states to emerge as the Mauryan Empire.[89] The empire was once thought to have controlled most of the subcontinent except the far south, but its core regions are now thought to have been separated by large autonomous areas.[90][91] The Mauryan kings are known as much for their empire-building and determined management of public life as for Ashoka's renunciation of militarism and far-flung advocacy of the Buddhist dhamma.[92][93]
The Sangam literature of the Tamil language reveals that, between 200 BCE and 200 CE, the southern peninsula was 
ruled by the Cheras, the Cholas, and the Pandyas, dynasties that traded extensively with the Roman Empire and with 
West and South-East Asia.[94][95] In North India, Hinduism asserted patriarchal control within the family, leading to 
increased subordination of women.[96][89] By the 4th and 5th centuries, the Gupta Empire had created a complex system of administration and taxation in the greater Ganges Plain; this system became a model for later Indian kingdoms.
[97][98] Under the Guptas, a renewed Hinduism based on devotion, rather than the management of ritual, began to 
assert itself.[99] This renewal was reflected in a flowering of sculpture and architecture, which found patrons among an
 urban elite.[98] Classical Sanskrit literature flowered as well, and Indian science, astronomy, medicine, and mathematics
 made significant advances.[98]In the early 16th century, northern India, then under mainly Muslim rulers,[113] fell again 
to the superior mobility and firepower of a new generation of Central Asian warriors.[114] The resulting Mughal Empire
 did not stamp out the local societies it came to rule. Instead, it balanced and pacified them through new administrative 
practices[115][116] and diverse and inclusive ruling elites,[117] leading to more systematic, centralised, and uniform rule.
[118] Eschewing tribal bonds and Islamic identity, especially under Akbar, the Mughals united their far-flung realms through loyalty, expressed through a Persianised culture, to an emperor who had near-divine status.[117] The Mughal 
state's economic policies, deriving most revenues from agriculture[119] and mandating that taxes be paid in the well-
regulated silver currency,[120] caused peasants and artisans to enter larger markets.[118] The relative peace maintained by the empire during much of the 17th century was a factor in India's economic expansion,[118] resulting in greater 
patronage of painting, literary forms, textiles, and architecture.[121] Newly coherent social groups in northern and 
western India, such as the Marathas, the Rajputs, and the Sikhs, gained military and governing ambitions during Mughal 
rule, which, through collaboration or adversity, gave them both recognition and military experience.[122] Expanding 
commerce during Mughal rule gave rise to new Indian commercial and political elites along the coasts of southern and eastern India.[122] As the empire disintegrated, many among these elites were able to seek and control their own affairs.[123]Historians consider India's modern age to have begun sometime between 1848 and 1885. The appointment in 1848 of Lord Dalhousie as Governor General of the East India Company set the stage for changes essential to a 
modern state. These included the consolidation and demarcation of sovereignty, the surveillance of the population, and 
the education of citizens. Technological changes—among them, railways, canals, and the telegraph—were introduced 
not long after their introduction in Europe.[131][132][133][134] However, disaffection with the company also grew
 during this time and set off the Indian Rebellion of 1857. Fed by diverse resentments and perceptions, including invasive
 British-style social reforms, harsh land taxes, and summary treatment of some rich landowners and princes, the rebellion
 rocked many regions of northern and central India and shook the foundations of Company rule.[135][136] Although the 
rebellion was suppressed by 1858, it led to the dissolution of the East India Company and the direct administration of 
India by the British government. Proclaiming a unitary state and a gradual but limited British-style parliamentary system,
 the new rulers also protected princes and landed gentry as a feudal safeguard against future unrest.[137][138] In the 
decades following, public life gradually emerged all over India, leading eventually to the founding of the Indian National 
Congress in 1885.[139][140][141][142]The rush of technology and the commercialisation of agriculture in the second half of the 19th century was marked by economic setbacks and many small farmers became dependent on the whims of 
far-away markets.[143] There was an increase in the number of large-scale famines,[144] and, despite the risks of 
infrastructure development borne by Indian taxpayers, little industrial employment was generated for Indians.[145] There
 were also salutary effects: commercial cropping, especially in the newly canalled Punjab, led to increased food 
production for internal consumption.[146] The railway network provided critical famine relief,[147] notably reduced the 
cost of moving goods,[147] and helped nascent Indian-owned industry.[146]
After World War I, in which approximately one million Indians served,[148] a new period began. It was marked by British reforms but also repressive legislation, by more strident Indian calls for self-rule, and by the beginnings of a nonviolent movement of non-co-operation, of which Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi would become the leader and enduring symbol.[149] During the 1930s, slow legislative reform was enacted by the British; the Indian National Congress won victories in the resulting elections.[150] The next decade was beset with crises: Indian participation in World War II, the Congress's final push for non-co-operation, and an upsurge of Muslim nationalism. All were capped by the advent of independence in 1947, but tempered by the partition of India into two states: India and Pakistan.[151] Vital to India's self-image as an independent nation was its constitution, completed in 1950, which put in place a secular and democratic
 republic.[152] It has remained a democracy with civil liberties, an active Supreme Court, and a largely independent press
.[153] Economic liberalisation, which began in the 1990s, has created a large urban middle class, transformed India into 
one of the world's fastest-growing economies,[154] and increased its geopolitical clout. Indian movies, music, and 
spiritual teachings play an increasing role in global culture.[153] Yet, India is also shaped by seemingly unyielding poverty, 
both rural and urban;[153] by religious and caste-related violence;[155] by Maoist-inspired Naxalite insurgencies;[156] and
 by separatism in Jammu and Kashmir and in Northeast India.[157] It has unresolved territorial disputes with China[158] 
and with Pakistan.[158] India's sustained democratic freedoms are unique among the world's newer nations; however, in
 spite of its recent economic successes, freedom from want for its disadvantaged population remains a goal yet to be 
achieved.
